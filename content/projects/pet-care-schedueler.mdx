Welcome animal lovers! In this project, we'll create an interactive virtual pet system that combines pet care with educational content about different animal species.

## Project Overview
You'll build a system that:
- Creates virtual pets with unique characteristics
- Tracks pet needs (hunger, happiness, energy)
- Provides pet care activities
- Includes an encyclopedia of animal facts
- Saves pet status and progress

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of classes and methods
- Familiarity with dictionaries and file handling

## Getting Started
Let's create the foundation for our Pet class! Here's your starter code with TODOs:

```python
class Pet:
    def __init__(self, name, species):
        # TODO: Initialize pet attributes (name, species, hunger, happiness, energy)
        # Hint: Set initial values for hunger, happiness, and energy (0-100)
        pass
        
    def feed(self, food_amount):
        # TODO: Increase pet's fullness and happiness based on food_amount
        # Hint: Don't let values go above 100
        pass
    
    def play(self, play_time):
        # TODO: Increase happiness but decrease energy
        # Hint: Consider how play_time affects the values
        pass
    
    def rest(self, rest_time):
        # TODO: Increase energy but decrease happiness slightly
        # Hint: Balance the energy gain with happiness loss
        pass
    
    def get_status(self):
        # TODO: Return a dictionary with the pet's current stats
        # Hint: Include all important pet attributes
        pass

class AnimalEncyclopedia:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Initialize the encyclopedia with some basic animal facts
        # Hint: Use a dictionary to store species information
        pass
    
    def add_species(self, species, facts):
        # TODO: Add a new species and its facts to the encyclopedia
        pass
    
    def get_species_info(self, species):
        # TODO: Return facts about the specified species
        # Hint: Handle cases where species isn't found
        pass
```

## Key Concepts to Implement

### Pet Status Management
Think about how to realistically simulate pet needs:
- Hunger increases over time
- Energy decreases with activity
- Happiness affected by multiple factors
- All values should stay within 0-100

### Encyclopedia Features
Consider what information to include:
- Habitat
- Diet
- Lifespan
- Fun facts
- Care requirements

### Save System
Plan how to store:
- Current pet status
- Encyclopedia entries
- Care history

## Hints for Implementation

### Pet Status Calculations
```python
# Example of balancing status changes
def play(self, play_time):
    # Convert play_time to appropriate status changes
    # For example: 10 minutes of play might:
    # - Increase happiness by play_time * 2
    # - Decrease energy by play_time
    # - Increase hunger by play_time / 2
    pass
```

### Activity Validation
```python
# Example of validating activities
def feed(self, food_amount):
    # Check if food_amount is reasonable
    # Update hunger status
    # Consider adding different food types
    pass
```

### Species Information
```python
# Example species data structure
species_info = {
    "dog": {
        "diet": ["omnivore"],
        "lifespan": "10-13 years",
        "habitat": "domestic",
        "care_tips": [
            "Regular exercise needed",
            "Social interaction important",
            "Regular vet check-ups"
        ]
    }
}
```

## Challenge Tasks
1. Add different food types with varying effects
2. Implement pet moods based on status combinations
3. Create daily care schedules
4. Add growth stages for pets
5. Include pet-specific behaviors

## Tips for Success
- Keep status changes balanced
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments explaining your logic
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Test with different scenarios

Remember: A happy pet means managing all needs together - not just maxing out one stat!

## Extension Ideas
- Add pet personalities
- Include medical care
- Create pet interactions
- Add achievements system
- Implement weather effects
