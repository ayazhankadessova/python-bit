Welcome fashion enthusiasts! In this project, we'll create an intelligent fashion assistant that helps users manage their wardrobe, coordinate outfits, and discover their personal style.

## Project Overview
You'll build a system that:
- Manages a virtual wardrobe
- Suggests outfit combinations
- Conducts style preference quizzes
- Provides fashion recommendations
- Tracks favorite outfits

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of classes and methods
- Familiarity with dictionaries and lists

## Getting Started
Let's create our core classes! Here's your starter code with TODOs:

```python
from typing import List, Dict
from enum import Enum

class ClothingType(Enum):
    TOP = "top"
    BOTTOM = "bottom"
    DRESS = "dress"
    OUTERWEAR = "outerwear"
    SHOES = "shoes"
    ACCESSORY = "accessory"

class Season(Enum):
    SPRING = "spring"
    SUMMER = "summer"
    FALL = "fall"
    WINTER = "winter"
    ALL = "all"

class Style(Enum):
    CASUAL = "casual"
    BUSINESS = "business"
    FORMAL = "formal"
    SPORTY = "sporty"
    BOHEMIAN = "bohemian"

class ClothingItem:
    def __init__(self, name: str, type: ClothingType, color: str):
        # TODO: Initialize clothing item attributes
        # Consider: style, season, occasions, brand
        pass
    
    def matches_with(self, other: 'ClothingItem') -> bool:
        # TODO: Check if two items match based on color and style
        # Hint: Consider color theory and style compatibility
        pass
    
    def suitable_for_season(self, season: Season) -> bool:
        # TODO: Check if item is suitable for given season
        pass

class Wardrobe:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Initialize wardrobe storage
        # Group items by type for easier access
        pass
    
    def add_item(self, item: ClothingItem):
        # TODO: Add new item to wardrobe
        # Organize by type and maintain counts
        pass
    
    def remove_item(self, item: ClothingItem):
        # TODO: Remove item from wardrobe
        pass
    
    def suggest_outfit(self, style: Style, season: Season) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Generate outfit suggestion based on style and season
        # Include: top, bottom, shoes, accessories
        pass
    
    def get_stats(self) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Calculate wardrobe statistics
        # Count by type, style, color, etc.
        pass

class StyleQuiz:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Initialize quiz questions and scoring
        pass
    
    def add_question(self, question: str, options: List[str], style_points: Dict[Style, int]):
        # TODO: Add quiz question with style points
        pass
    
    def take_quiz(self) -> Style:
        # TODO: Present questions and calculate dominant style
        pass
    
    def get_recommendations(self, style: Style) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Provide style-specific recommendations
        pass
```

## Key Concepts to Implement

### Color Matching
Consider basic color theory:
- Complementary colors
- Monochromatic looks
- Seasonal color palettes

Example color matching logic:
```python
def are_colors_compatible(color1: str, color2: str) -> bool:
    # Define color families and relationships
    complementary_pairs = {
        "blue": ["orange", "coral"],
        "purple": ["yellow", "gold"],
        "red": ["green", "mint"]
    }
    
    # Consider neutrals
    neutrals = ["black", "white", "gray", "beige"]
    
    # Implement matching logic
    pass
```

### Outfit Generation
Think about outfit composition rules:
- Style consistency
- Color harmony
- Season appropriateness
- Occasion suitability

Example suggestion system:
```python
def create_outfit_base(style: Style, season: Season) -> Dict:
    # Start with essential pieces
    # Build around a key item
    # Add complementary pieces
    # Consider layering for season
    pass
```

### Style Quiz System
Plan quiz structure:
- Multiple choice questions
- Style point system
- Results analysis
- Recommendations

Example quiz question:
```python
question_template = {
    "text": "What's your ideal weekend outfit?",
    "options": [
        "Jeans and t-shirt",
        "Sundress and sandals",
        "Athletic wear",
        "Bohemian maxi dress"
    ],
    "style_points": {
        Style.CASUAL: [3, 0, 0, 0],
        Style.BOHEMIAN: [0, 1, 0, 3],
        Style.SPORTY: [0, 0, 3, 0]
    }
}
```

## Data Structures

### Clothing Item Structure
```python
clothing_item = {
    "name": str,
    "type": ClothingType,
    "color": str,
    "style": Style,
    "seasons": List[Season],
    "occasions": List[str],
    "brand": str,
    "favorite": bool
}
```

### Wardrobe Organization
```python
wardrobe_structure = {
    "tops": List[ClothingItem],
    "bottoms": List[ClothingItem],
    "dresses": List[ClothingItem],
    "outerwear": List[ClothingItem],
    "shoes": List[ClothingItem],
    "accessories": List[ClothingItem]
}
```

### Style Profile
```python
style_profile = {
    "primary_style": Style,
    "secondary_style": Style,
    "preferred_colors": List[str],
    "avoided_colors": List[str],
    "favorite_outfits": List[Dict]
}
```

## Challenge Tasks
1. Implement advanced color matching
2. Add outfit history tracking
3. Create style boards
4. Add seasonal wardrobe transitions
5. Implement outfit rating system

## Tips for Success
- Start with basic matching rules
- Use enums for consistent categories
- Handle invalid combinations gracefully
- Consider user preferences
- Document style rules

## Extension Ideas
