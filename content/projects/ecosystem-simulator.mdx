## Ecosystem Simulator
Welcome young scientists! Let's build a digital ecosystem where plants, herbivores, and carnivores interact. You'll learn about food chains, population dynamics, and how different species depend on each other.

## Project Overview
You'll create a simulation that:
- Models different species (plants, rabbits, foxes)
- Shows how populations change over time
- Demonstrates food chain relationships
- Visualizes ecosystem health
- Includes weather effects on the ecosystem

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of lists and dictionaries
- Simple math operations

## Getting Started 
Here's your starter code with fun TODOs:

```python
from typing import Dict, List
import random

class Species:
    def __init__(self, name: str, population: int):
        # TODO: Set up the species with its starting population
        # 🌟 Hint: Store name and population
        pass
    
    def update_population(self, food_available: int, weather_condition: str) -> None:
        # TODO: Change population based on food and weather
        # 🌟 Hint: Good weather = more babies!
        pass

class Plant(Species):
    def grow(self, sunlight: int, water: int) -> int:
        # TODO: Calculate how much the plants grow
        # 🌟 Hint: More sunlight + water = more growth
        pass

class Animal(Species):
    def __init__(self, name: str, population: int, food_type: str):
        # TODO: Set up the animal with what it eats
        # 🌟 Hint: Remember its favorite food!
        pass
    
    def hunt(self, available_food: int) -> int:
        # TODO: Figure out how much food the animal catches
        # 🌟 Hint: Not every hunt is successful
        pass

class Ecosystem:
    def __init__(self):
        # TODO: Create your ecosystem with different species
        # 🌟 Hint: Start with plants, rabbits, and foxes
        pass
    
    def simulate_day(self, weather: str) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Run one day in your ecosystem
        # 🌟 Hint: First grow plants, then feed animals
        pass
    
    def get_population_stats(self) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Count how many of each species exist
        # 🌟 Hint: Make a dictionary of species names and numbers
        pass
```

## How Your Simulation Works

### The Food Chain
Think about who eats who:
- Plants need sunlight and water 🌱
- Rabbits eat plants 🐰
- Foxes hunt rabbits 🦊

### Weather Effects
Different weather changes your ecosystem:
- Sunny: Plants grow more! 🌞
- Rainy: More water for plants 🌧️
- Cloudy: Less plant growth ☁️

### Population Changes
Remember:
- Animals need enough food to survive
- Good conditions mean more babies
- Not enough food means population goes down

## Fun Challenges
1. Add more animal species 
2. Create seasonal changes
3. Add different types of plants
4. Make natural disasters
5. Track ecosystem history

## Testing Your Code
Try this test file to check your work:

```python
def test_ecosystem():
    print("🌿 Testing Ecosystem Simulator...")
    
    try:
        # Test 1: Creating Species
        print("\nTest 1: Making new species")
        grass = Plant("Grass", 100)
        rabbit = Animal("Rabbit", 30, "plant")
        assert hasattr(grass, "population"), "❌ Species needs a population!"
        print("✅ Species created successfully!")
        
        # Test 2: Plant Growth
        print("\nTest 2: Growing plants")
        growth = grass.grow(sunlight=10, water=5)
        assert isinstance(growth, int), "❌ Growth must be a number!"
        assert growth >= 0, "❌ Growth can't be negative!"
        print("✅ Plants are growing!")
        
        # Test 3: Animal Hunting
        print("\nTest 3: Animal hunting")
        caught = rabbit.hunt(available_food=50)
        assert isinstance(caught, int), "❌ Caught food must be a number!"
        assert caught <= 50, "❌ Can't catch more food than available!"
        print("✅ Animals can hunt!")
        
        # Test 4: Ecosystem Simulation
        print("\nTest 4: Running ecosystem")
        eco = Ecosystem()
        day_results = eco.simulate_day("sunny")
        assert isinstance(day_results, dict), "❌ Day results should be a dictionary!"
        print("✅ Ecosystem is running!")
        
        print("\n🎉 All tests passed! Your ecosystem is alive!")
        return True
        
    except AssertionError as e:
        print(f"\n❌ Test failed: {str(e)}")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n❌ Error occurred: {str(e)}")
        return False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_ecosystem()
```

## Tips for Success
- Start small with just a few species
- Test each part as you build it
- Add comments to explain your code
- Think about real ecosystems
- Have fun experimenting!

Remember: A healthy ecosystem needs balance - if one species has too many or too few members, it affects everything else!

## Extra Ideas
- Add animal movement
- Create food preferences 
- Make species compete
- Add different habitats
- Track endangered species
