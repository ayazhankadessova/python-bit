# Aura Points Calculator

Welcome future game developer! In this project, we'll create a system to track and calculate character energy levels, inspired by popular anime and games.

## Project Overview

You'll build a calculator that:
- Tracks base aura points
- Calculates power-ups and debuffs
- Shows visual representation of energy levels
- Saves character progress

## Getting Started

First, let's create the basic structure:

```python
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, base_aura=100):
        self.name = name
        self.base_aura = base_aura
        self.current_aura = base_aura
        self.buffs = []
        self.debuffs = []
```
