Welcome future game developer! In this project, we'll create a system to track and calculate character energy levels, inspired by popular anime and games.

## Project Overview
You'll build a calculator that:
- Tracks base aura points
- Calculates power-ups and debuffs
- Shows visual representation of energy levels
- Saves character progress

## Prerequisites
- Basic Python knowledge
- Understanding of classes and methods
- Familiarity with lists and dictionaries

## Getting Started  
### 1. Let's create the basic structure for our `Character` class:  

Before adding game mechanics, we need a foundational class to represent our characters. Each character will have:  


- A `name` to identify them.  
- A `base_aura`, which is their starting aura level (default is 100).  
- A `current_aura` that tracks their aura as it changes during the game.  
- Two lists, `buffs` and `debuffs`, to store any temporary effects that strengthen or weaken the character.  

Here's how it should look start like:  

```python
class Character:
    def __init__(self, name, base_aura=100):
        self.name = name
        .
        .
        .
```

### 2. Adding Buffs and Debuffs  

Now that we have a basic `Character` class, let's add functionality to apply buffs (power-ups) and debuffs (power-downs) that modify a character's aura.  

#### 2.1 Adding Buffs  

Buffs increase the character’s aura. The `add_buff` method:  
- Takes a `name` and a `power_increase` value.  
- Appends the `name` and the `power_increase` as a set to the `buffs` list.  
- Recalculates the character’s current aura.  

```python
def add_buff(self, name, power_increase):
    """Add a power-up buff to the character"""
    .
    .
    .
```

#### 2.2 Adding Debuffs  

Debuffs decrease the character’s aura. The `add_debuff` method:  
- Takes a `name` and a `power_decrease` value.  
- Adds the` name` and `power_decrease` as a set to the `debuffs` list.  
- Recalculates the character’s current aura.  

```python
def add_debuff(self, name, power_decrease):
    """Add a power-down debuff to the character"""
    .
    .
    .
```

### 3. Calculating Aura  

Every time a buff or debuff is applied, the aura needs to be recalculated. The `calculate_current_aura` method:  
- Starts with the `base_aura` value.  
- Adds all buff effects.  
- Subtracts all debuff effects.  
- Ensures the aura never goes below 0.  

```python
def calculate_current_aura(self):
    """Calculate total aura points including buffs and debuffs"""
    total = self.base_aura
    
    # Add all buff effects
    for buff in self.buffs:
        .
        .
        .
        
    # Subtract all debuff effects
    for debuff in self.debuffs:
        .
        .
        .
    
    # Ensure aura doesn't go below 0
    self.current_aura = max(0, total)
    return self.current_aura
```

### 4. Displaying Character Status  

To check a character’s current aura, buffs, and debuffs, we add the `display_status` method:  
- Prints the base and current aura.  
- Lists active buffs and debuffs (if any).  

```python
def display_status(self):
    """Display character's current status"""
    print(f"\nCharacter Status: ")
    print("=" * 30)
    print(f"Base Aura: ")
    print(f"Current Aura: ")
    
    if self.buffs:
        print("\nActive Buffs:")
        for buff in self.buffs:
            print(f"- {?}: + {?}")
            
    if self.debuffs:
        print("\nActive Debuffs:")
        for debuff in self.debuffs:
            print(f"- {?}: -{?}")
```

## Visual Representation
Let's add a method to show a visual representation of the character's energy level:

```python
def show_aura_bar(self, width=50):
    """Display a visual representation of the aura level"""
    percentage = self.current_aura / self.base_aura
    filled_length = int(width * percentage)
    bar = '█' * filled_length + '░' * (width - filled_length)
    print(f"\nAura Level: {self.current_aura}/{self.base_aura}")
    print(f"[{bar}] {percentage:.1%}")
```

## Save and Load Feature
Now, let's add the ability to save and load character data:

```python
import json

def save_character(self, filename):
    """Save character data to a JSON file"""
    data = {
        "name": self.name,
        "base_aura": self.base_aura,
        "current_aura": self.current_aura,
        "buffs": self.buffs,
        "debuffs": self.debuffs
    }
    with open(filename, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f)
    print(f"\nCharacter data saved to {filename}")

@classmethod
def load_character(cls, filename):
    """Load character data from a JSON file"""
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
    character = cls(data["name"], data["base_aura"])
    character.current_aura = data["current_aura"]
    character.buffs = data["buffs"]
    character.debuffs = data["debuffs"]
    return character
```

## Example Usage
Here's how to use the Aura Points Calculator:


```python
# Create a new character
hero = Character("Zephyr", base_aura=100)

# Add some buffs and debuffs
hero.add_buff("Training", 20)
hero.add_buff("Magic Crystal", 15)
hero.add_debuff("Exhaustion", 10)

# Display status and visual representation
hero.display_status()
hero.show_aura_bar()

# Save character data
hero.save_character("hero_data.json")

# Load character data
loaded_hero = Character.load_character("hero_data.json")
```

## Challenge Tasks
1. Add a method to remove buffs and debuffs
2. Implement a time limit for buffs/debuffs
3. Create different character classes with unique base stats
4. Add special abilities that temporarily boost aura
5. Implement a battle system between two characters

## Tips
- Always validate input values to prevent negative numbers
- Consider adding maximum limits to prevent overpowered characters
- Use descriptive names for buffs and debuffs
- Add error handling for file operations
- Consider adding different types of aura (e.g., attack, defense)

## Sample Output
```
Character Status: Zephyr
==============================
Base Aura: 100
Current Aura: 125

Active Buffs:
- Training: +20
- Magic Crystal: +15

Active Debuffs:
- Exhaustion: -10

Aura Level: 125/100
[████████████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 125.0%
```

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You've built a complete aura points system that you can use in your games. This project demonstrates:

- Data persistence with JSON
- Visual representation of data
- Game mechanics fundamentals

Feel free to expand upon this system by adding more features or integrating it into a larger game project!
