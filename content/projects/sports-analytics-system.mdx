Welcome sports enthusiasts and data analysts! In this advanced project, we'll create a powerful sports analytics system that combines statistical analysis with tournament management.

## Project Overview
You'll build a system that:
- Tracks comprehensive team statistics
- Calculates advanced player metrics
- Generates and manages tournament brackets
- Provides performance predictions
- Visualizes statistical trends

## Prerequisites
- Strong Python knowledge
- Understanding of statistical concepts
- Experience with data structures
- Basic knowledge of sports metrics

## Getting Started
Let's create our core classes! Here's your starter code with TODOs:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Optional
import math
import random

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name: str, position: str):
        # TODO: Initialize player attributes
        # Consider: games_played, minutes, points, assists, rebounds
        pass
    
    def add_game_stats(self, minutes: int, points: int, assists: int, rebounds: int):
        # TODO: Add stats from a new game
        # Remember to update averages
        pass
    
    def calculate_efficiency(self) -> float:
        # TODO: Calculate player efficiency rating
        # Hint: Consider points, assists, rebounds in formula
        pass
    
    def get_stats_summary(self) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Return dictionary of player's current stats
        pass

class Team:
    def __init__(self, name: str, division: str):
        # TODO: Initialize team attributes
        # Track: players, wins, losses, points_for, points_against
        pass
    
    def add_player(self, player: Player):
        # TODO: Add player to team
        # Validate player data first
        pass
    
    def record_game(self, points_scored: int, points_allowed: int, won: bool):
        # TODO: Update team statistics after game
        # Update win/loss record and points
        pass
    
    def calculate_win_percentage(self) -> float:
        # TODO: Calculate team's win percentage
        pass
    
    def get_team_stats(self) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Return comprehensive team statistics
        pass

class Tournament:
    def __init__(self, name: str, num_teams: int):
        # TODO: Initialize tournament attributes
        # Consider: teams, bracket structure, rounds
        pass
    
    def add_team(self, team: Team):
        # TODO: Add team to tournament
        # Validate team eligibility
        pass
    
    def generate_bracket(self):
        # TODO: Generate tournament bracket
        # Hint: Use seeding based on team stats
        pass
    
    def simulate_round(self):
        # TODO: Simulate one round of tournament
        # Consider team stats in win probability
        pass
    
    def get_bracket_state(self) -> Dict:
        # TODO: Return current tournament bracket
        pass
```

## Implementation Guide

### Player Analytics
Consider these metrics for player analysis:
- Points per game
- Assists per game
- Rebounds per game
- Minutes per game
- Efficiency rating (custom formula)
- Shooting percentages

Sample efficiency formula:
```python
def calculate_efficiency(self) -> float:
    # Common efficiency formula:
    # (Points + Rebounds + Assists) * Minutes_Played / Games_Played
    # Add your own modifiers for advanced analysis
    pass
```

### Team Performance Metrics
Track these team statistics:
- Win/Loss record
- Points per game
- Points allowed
- Point differential
- Home/Away performance
- Winning streaks

Example win percentage calculation:
```python
def calculate_win_percentage(self) -> float:
    # Consider edge cases:
    # - No games played
    # - Division by zero prevention
    # - Rounding considerations
    pass
```

### Tournament System
Implement these tournament features:
- Seeding system
- Bracket generation
- Round simulation
- Advancement tracking
- Championship path

Bracket generation tips:
```python
def generate_bracket(self):
    # For a 8-team tournament:
    # Round 1: 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5
    # Consider:
    # - Power of 2 validation
    # - Seeding based on record
    # - Bye weeks for uneven numbers
    pass
```

## Data Structures

### Player Stats Structure
```python
player_stats = {
    "games_played": int,
    "minutes": {
        "total": int,
        "average": float
    },
    "points": {
        "total": int,
        "average": float
    },
    "efficiency": float
}
```

### Team Stats Structure
```python
team_stats = {
    "record": {
        "wins": int,
        "losses": int
    },
    "points": {
        "scored": int,
        "allowed": int,
        "differential": float
    },
    "streaks": {
        "current": int,
        "longest": int
    }
}
```

### Tournament Bracket Structure
```python
bracket = {
    "rounds": [
        {
            "round_number": int,
            "matches": [
                {
                    "team1": Team,
                    "team2": Team,
                    "winner": Optional[Team]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
