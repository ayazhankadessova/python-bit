# Level Up: String Formatting Magic! ✨

Hey coding champions! Remember how we used operators to combine strings and numbers? Now it's time to learn an even cooler way to create awesome text outputs! Get ready to become a Text Formatting Wizard! 🧙‍♂️

## Today's Quest! 🎯
In this magical adventure, you'll learn how to:
- Create dynamic game messages using string formatting 💬
- Display player stats like a pro gamer 🎮
- Format numbers for your game's scoreboard 🏆
- Create awesome item descriptions 📝
- Master the secret codes of string formatting 🔍

## String Formatting: Your New Superpower! 🦸‍♂️

Remember when we used `+` to combine strings? Well, get ready for something even more powerful! String formatting is like having a template for your text where you can plug in different values. It's like having customizable game dialogue!

### Basic Spells (Simple Formatting) 🪄

```python showLineNumbers
# Instead of this:
player_name = "Alex"
print("Welcome to the game, " + player_name + "!")

# You can do this - much cleaner!
print("Welcome to the game, %s!" % player_name)

# Let's make a player status message:
name = "Alex"
level = 5
health = 100
print("Player %s (Level %d) - HP: %d" % (name, level, health))
```

### Crafting Game Messages (Multiple Values) 🎨

```python showLineNumbers
# Create a cool game inventory message
weapon = "Sword"
damage = 75
durability = 98.5

# This creates a neat item description
print("Item: %s | Damage: %d | Durability: %.1f%%" % (weapon, damage, durability))
```

### The Magic Symbols (Format Specifiers) 🔮

Think of these as special ingredients for your text potions:
```python showLineNumbers
# %s - For strings (text)
player_class = "Wizard"
print("Class: %s" % player_class)

# %d - For integers (whole numbers)
coins = 150
print("Gold: %d" % coins)

# %.2f - For decimal numbers (with 2 decimal places)
accuracy = 98.7654
print("Accuracy: %.2f%%" % accuracy)  # Shows 98.77%
```

## 🎮 Mini-Game: The Item Shop!

Let's create a cool item shop display:

```python showLineNumbers
# Item shop inventory
item_name = "Health Potion"
price = 50
effectiveness = 75.5

# Create a fancy shop listing
shop_template = """
🏪 MAGIC SHOP 🏪
================
Item: %s
Price: %d gold
Effect: +%.1f HP
================"""

print(shop_template % (item_name, price, effectiveness))
```

## 🌟 Super Challenges!

1. **Create a Player Card:**
```python showLineNumbers
# Create a cool player status card using this info
player_name = "DragonSlayer"
level = 10
health = 95.5
weapon = "Flame Sword"

# Your code here - make it look awesome!
# Hint: Use multiple lines with \n for better formatting
```

2. **High Score Board:**
```python showLineNumbers
# Format this high score data nicely
rank = 1
player = "CoolGamer123"
score = 1000000
accuracy = 98.7654

# Create a formatter that shows:
# #1 | CoolGamer123 | 1,000,000 pts | 98.77% acc
```

## 🎯 Debug Mission: Fix the Formatting!

Can you spot what's wrong with these formatting attempts?

```python showLineNumbers
# Bug 1: Why doesn't this work?
level = 5
print("Level: %d%" % level)  # Trying to show percentage

# Bug 2: What's wrong here?
name = "Alex"
score = 100
print("Player %s scored %s points" % score)  # Missing something?

# Bug 3: Fix the decimal places
money = 12.3456
print("Gold: %.f" % money)  # Want to show 2 decimal places
```

## 🎮 Final Challenge: Create a Game Status Screen!

Make an awesome game status screen using everything you've learned:

```python showLineNumbers
# Game stats
player_name = "YourNameHere"
health = 85.5
mana = 50
gold = 1234
position = "X: 123, Y: 456"

# Create a status screen like this:
"""
=======================
🎮 GAME STATUS 🎮
=======================
Player: (name here)
HP: ■■■■■■■■□□ (85.5%)
MP: ■■■■■□□□□□ (50%)
Gold: 1,234 coins
Location: (position)
=======================
"""
# Your code here!
```

Remember:
- `%s` is for text (strings)
- `%d` is for whole numbers
- `%.2f` is for decimal numbers (with 2 decimal places)
- Use `()` when formatting multiple values
- The number of `%` symbols should match your values
