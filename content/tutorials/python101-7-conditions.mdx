# Level Up: Decision-Making Powers! 🎮

Hey coding champions! Remember those awesome string powers we learned? Now it's time to learn something even cooler - how to make your code THINK and DECIDE! Just like in games where you choose different paths on your quest, conditional statements let your code make smart choices! 🧙‍♂️

## Today's Quest! 🎯
You'll learn how to:
- Make your code choose different paths like in an adventure game! 🗺️
- Use magical comparison operators to test conditions ✨
- Chain multiple decisions together for complex quests 🔗
- Check if items exist in your inventory using the 'in' operator 🎒

## Your First Decision Spell: if Statements! 🪄

Think of `if` statements like magical gates - if something is true, you get to pass through! Let's try it:

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`player_name = "DragonSlayer"

# Check if the player name is long enough
if len(player_name) >= 3:
    print("Welcome to the game, " + player_name + "!")
else:
    print("Name too short! Choose a longer name!")

# Check if it's a special character name
if player_name.startswith("Dragon"):
    print("🐲 You have dragon-taming powers!")`}
  exercise_number={1}
  expectedOutput={false}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

🎮 **Quick Game**: Try changing the player_name to different values:
- "Pi" (too short!)
- "SuperWarrior" (perfect!)
- "Zx" (too short!)

## Level 2: Dragon Alert System! 🐲

Now let's check for special powers:

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`if player_name.startswith("Dragon"):
    print("🐲 You have dragon-taming powers!")`}
  exercise_number={1}
  expectedOutput={false}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

Cool, right? Your code just made its first decision! 

## Comparison Magic: Testing Conditions! ⚔️

🔍 **Time to learn the magical comparison symbols:**:
- `==` : Is equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
- `<=` : Less than or equal to

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`player_health = 100
dragon_nearby = True

# Different ways to compare things:
if player_health == 100:    # Equal to
    print("Health is full! ❤️")
    
if player_health > 50:      # Greater than
    print("Ready for battle! ⚔️")
    
if dragon_nearby != False:  # Not equal to
    print("Dragon alert! 🐲")`}
  exercise_number={2}
  expectedOutput={false}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

## 🎮 Mini-Game Break: Guess the Output!

What do you think this code will print?

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`wizard_power = 75

if wizard_power > 50:
    print("Super powerful! ⚡")
if wizard_power < 100:
    print("Still room to grow! 📚")`}
  exercise_number={2}
  expectedOutput={false}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

Take a guess before trying it out!

## Secret Inventory Checker: the 'in' Operator! 🎒

Ever wanted to check if you have an item in your backpack? Here's how:

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Using our string split power from last lesson!
inventory = "Sword,Shield,Potion,Map".split(",")

if "Sword" in inventory:
    print("You're armed and ready! ⚔️")`}
  exercise_number={3}
  expectedOutput={false}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

🎮 **Fun Fact**: The `in` operator is like a magical detector that can find things in lists!

## Multiple Choice Paths: elif Adventures! 🗺️

Sometimes you need more than just yes/no choices. Enter `elif` - your new best friend!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`player_class = "Mage"

if player_class.lower() == "warrior":
    print("You charge into battle with your sword! ⚔️")
elif player_class.lower() == "mage":
    print("You cast powerful spells! 🔮")
elif player_class.lower() == "archer":
    print("You attack from a distance! 🏹")
else:
    print("Unknown class! Create your own adventure!")`}
  exercise_number={4}
  expectedOutput={false}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

🎮 **Try It**: Change player_class to different values and see what happens!

## Boss Battle: Complex Conditions! 🐉

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`dragon_health = 100
player_level = 5
has_magic_sword = True

if (player_level >= 5 and has_magic_sword) or dragon_health < 50:
    print("You can defeat the dragon! 🗡️")
else:
    print("Train more or find the magic sword! 💪")`}
  exercise_number={5}
  expectedOutput={false}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

## 🎮 Mini-Game: The Quest Checker!


<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Quest status checker
quest_status = "ACTIVE"
quest_items_found = ["map", "compass", "key"]
quest_level = 3

# Your mission:
# 1. Check if the quest is "ACTIVE"
# 2. Check if the player has all required items
# 3. Check if player meets minimum level (level 2)
# Write your code here!`}
  exercise_number={6}
  expectedOutput={true}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

## 🌟 Super Challenge: Create a Game Choice System!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# You're at a crossroads in your adventure!
path_chosen = "cave"
player_hp = 80
has_torch = True

# Create conditions to check:
# 1. If player chose "cave":
#    - Must have torch and hp > 50
# 2. If player chose "mountain":
#    - Must have hp > 70
# 3. If player chose "forest":
#    - Can enter anytime!

# Your code here!`}
  exercise_number={7}
  expectedOutput={true}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

## 🎯 Debug Mission: Fix the Game Logic!

Can you spot what's wrong with these conditions?


<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Bug 1: Why doesn't this work?
player_power = "100"
if player_power > 50:
    print("Super strong!")`}
  exercise_number={8}
  expectedOutput={true}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

Hint: Look carefully at the type of player_power!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`weapon = "Sword"
if weapon = "Sword":
    print("Armed!")`}
  exercise_number={9}
  expectedOutput={true}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>

Hint: Check the comparison operator!


## Pro Tips for Victory! 🏆

Remember:
- Always check your comparison operators `(==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)`
- Pay attention to your indentation - Python is picky!
- String comparison is case-sensitive ("Sword" != "sword")
- Use 'and' to check multiple conditions that all must be True
- Use 'or' when any one condition can be True

## Final Boss Challenge: Create a Complete Game Check System!

Ready for the ultimate test? Create a complete game check system!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Create a system that checks:
player_stats = """
NAME: MightyHero
LEVEL: 7
HEALTH: 85
INVENTORY: Sword,Shield,Potion
CURRENT_QUEST: DefeatDragon
"""

# 1. Parse the player_stats (use your string powers!)
# 2. Check if player is ready for dragon battle:
#    - Level must be 5 or higher
#    - Health must be above 80
#    - Must have both Sword and Shield
#    - Current quest must be "DefeatDragon"
# 3. Print appropriate messages for each condition

# Your code here!`}
  exercise_number={11}
  expectedOutput={true}
  tutorial_id="python101-7-conditions"
/>
