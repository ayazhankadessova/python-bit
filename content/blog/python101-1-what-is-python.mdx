# Welcome to the World of Python! 🐍

Hey there, future coder! Ready to start an awesome adventure in programming? You're about to learn Python - one of the coolest and most popular programming languages in the world. Fun fact: Python wasn't named after the snake, but after Monty Python's Flying Circus! 😄

## What Makes Python So Special? 

Imagine if you could talk to your computer in almost plain English - that's kind of what Python is like! It's like texting your friend, but you're texting instructions to your computer. It's so straightforward that even companies like Instagram, Netflix, and Spotify use it!

## Your First Python Program: Making Your Computer Say Hi! 👋

Remember when you first learned to say "Hello" in a different language? Well, we're going to teach your computer to say hello to the world! This is a super-famous first program that all coders start with.

Here's all you need to type:

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Write your code here
print("Hello, World!")`}
  expectedOutput="Hello, World!"
  exercise_number={1}
  tutorial_id="python101-1-what-is-python"
/>

That's it! Just one line, and you've written your first program! When you run this, your computer will say "Hello, World!" Pretty cool, right?

## The Secret Code of Spaces 🔍

Here's something interesting about Python - it's very particular about spaces! Think of it like organizing your locker or backpack. Everything needs to be in the right place. In Python, we use spaces (usually 4 of them) to keep our code organized.

For example:

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`
  you_are_awesome = True
  if you_are_awesome:
    print("Of course you are!")
else:
    print("Wait... you're still awesome!")`}
  expectedOutput="Wait... you're still awesome!"
  exercise_number={2}
  tutorial_id="python101-1-what-is-python"
/>

See those spaces before the print lines? They're like telling Python "these instructions belong together!"

## Time to Practice! 🎮

Now it's your turn to make your computer talk! Here's your mission, should you choose to accept it:

1. Make your computer say "Hello, Python!"

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`#your code goes here`}
  expectedOutput="Hello, Python!"
  exercise_number={3}
  tutorial_id="python101-1-what-is-python"
/>

## Fun Tips! 💡

- In Python 3 (the version we're using), remember your parentheses () in print statements - they're like giving your message a big hug!
- You can make your computer say anything - try making it tell a joke!
- The `#` symbol lets you write notes in your code that the computer will ignore (like passing notes in class, but allowed!)

## Quick Challenge! 🌟

Can you guess what these programs will print?

```python showLineNumbers 
print("Hello" + " " + "World!")
print("Hello" * 3)
```

(Try running them to check if you were right!)

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`print("Hello" + " " + "World!")
  print("Hello" * 3)
  `}
  exercise_number={4}
  tutorial_id="python101-1-what-is-python"
/>

Ready to write more cool programs? Let's go! Remember, every expert programmer started exactly where you are now. The only difference is they kept practicing and having fun with it! 

What would you like to make your computer say next? 🤔
