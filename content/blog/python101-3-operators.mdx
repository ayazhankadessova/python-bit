# Level Up: Python's Magic Tools - Operators! 🪄

## Today's Quest! 🎯
In this exciting adventure, you'll learn how to:
- Add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers like a math wizard! ✨
- Combine words and messages using string operators 📝
- Manage your game inventory with list operators 🎒
- Make decisions using comparison operators 🤔
- Create powerful combinations with logical operators 🧠

By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
1. Calculate game scores and power-ups
2. Create awesome character names
3. Combine inventory items
4. Make smart game decisions
5. Debug tricky code problems

Are you ready to power up your coding skills? Let's jump in! 🚀

## Arithmetic Operators: Your Calculator Superpowers! 🔢

Just like your calculator (but way cooler), Python can do math with special symbols:

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Let's power up our game character!
initial_health = 100
bonus_health = 50

# Addition (+): Powering up!
total_health = initial_health + bonus_health
print(f"Total Health: {total_health}") # 150 HP! 💪

# Multiplication (*): Multi-kill bonus!
score = 25 * 3
print(f"Score: {score}") # Triple kill! 🎯

# Division (/): Sharing loot with friends
treasure = 100 / 4 # Sharing with 4 players
print(f"Each player gets: {treasure} coins")

# Power-up (**): Level multiplier!
damage = 2 ** 3 # Power of 3!
print(f"Super attack damage: {damage}")

# Remainder (%): Checking for leftover loot
leftover_gems = 100 % 3 # Dividing gems between 3 players
print(f"Leftover gems: {leftover_gems}")`}
  exercise_number={1}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-operators"
/>

## String Operators: Word Magic! ✨

Remember our strings from last time? We can do magic with them too!

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Combining hero names (+ operator)
hero_first = "Super"
hero_last = "Coder"
hero_name = hero_first + " " + hero_last
print(f"Your hero name: {hero_name}")

# Making a crowd cheer (* operator)
crowd_cheer = "Hip Hip Hooray! " * 3
print(f"The crowd goes: {crowd_cheer}")
`}
  exercise_number={2}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-operators"
/>

## List Operators: Inventory Management! 🎒

Remember our lists? Let's use them with operators!

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Combining inventory from two treasure chests
chest_1 = ["sword", "shield"]
chest_2 = ["potion", "map"]
full_inventory = chest_1 + chest_2
print(f"You found: {full_inventory}")

# Duplicating power-ups
power_ups = ["⭐"] * 3
print(f"Power-ups collected: {power_ups}")  # ⭐⭐⭐
`}
  exercise_number={3}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-operators"
/>

## Comparison Operators: The Decision Makers! 🤔

These operators help your game make important decisions:

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Equal to (==)
secret_password = "PYTHON123"
player_input = "PYTHON123"
is_correct = secret_password == player_input
print("Password correct?", is_correct)  # True!

# Greater than (>)
player_level = 5
min_level = 3
can_enter_dungeon = player_level > min_level
print("Can enter dungeon?", can_enter_dungeon)  # True!

# Less than or equal to (<=)
max_players = 4
current_players = 3
can_join = current_players <= max_players
print("Can another player join?", can_join)  # True!
`}
  exercise_number={4}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-operators"
/>

## Logical Operators: The Brain Power! 🧠

These help you combine multiple conditions:

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# AND operator (both conditions must be True)
has_sword = True
has_shield = True
ready_for_battle = has_sword and has_shield
print("Ready for battle?", ready_for_battle)

# OR operator (at least one condition must be True)
has_magic = True
has_arrows = False
can_attack = has_magic or has_arrows
print("Can attack?", can_attack)

# NOT operator (flips True to False and vice versa)
is_game_over = False
is_playing = not is_game_over
print("Still playing?", is_playing)
`}
  exercise_number={5}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-operators"
/>

## 🎮 Mini-Game: The Operator Academy!

Let's create a simple game using our new operator powers!

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Let's power up our game character!
initial_health = 100
bonus_health = 50

# Addition (+): Add initial health and bonus health

total_health = ...
print(f"Total Health: {total_health}") # 150 HP! 💪

# Multiplication (*): Multiply by 3
score = 25 * ...
print(f"Score: {score}") # Triple kill! 🎯

# Division (/): Sharing loot with 4 friends
treasure = 100 / ... 
print(f"Each player gets: {treasure} coins")

# Power-up (**): # Fill in the base 2 and exponent 3
damage = _ ** _
print(f"Super attack damage: {damage}")

# Remainder (%): Checking for leftover loot, show remainder of 100 divided by 3
leftover_gems = 100 _ ...
print(f"Leftover gems: {leftover_gems}")`}
  expectedOutput={`Total Health: 150
  Score: 75
  Each player gets: 25.0 coins
  Super attack damage: 8
  Leftover gems: 1`}
  exercise_number={6}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-operators"
/>

## 🌟 Super Challenges!

1. **The Score Calculator:**

- Create a formula that:
1. Multiplies kills by multiplier
2. Adds the bonus
3. Prints "High Score!" if the result is over 100. Else: "Try Again!"

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Calculate the final score!
kills = 10
multiplier = 3
bonus = 50

# Your code here!`}
  expectedOutput={`High Score!`}
  exercise_number={7}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-operators"
/>

2. **The Inventory Master:**

1. Combine the inventories
2. Duplicate the result 2 times
3. Check if "sword" is in the inventory using 'in'

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Create the ultimate inventory!
starter_items = ["sword"]
found_items = ["shield", "potion"]
# Your code here!`}
  expectedOutput={`['sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'sword', 'shield', 'potion']
True`}
  exercise_number={8}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-collections"
/>

## 🎯 Debug Mission: Spot the Bugs!

Can you find what's wrong in this code?

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Bug 1: Why doesn't this work?
player_health = "100" + 50

# Bug 2: Why is this always False?
score = 100
high_score = 100
is_high_score = score = high_score

# Bug 3: What's wrong with this power-up check?
has_sword = True
has_shield = True
has_power = has_sword or has_shield and False

# Test
print(player_health)
print(is_high_score)
print(has_power)`}
  
  exercise_number={9}
  expectedOutput={`150
  True
  False`}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-collections"
/>

Remember:
- `+` adds numbers or combines strings/lists
- `*` multiplies numbers or repeats strings/lists
- `==` checks if things are equal
- `and`/`or` combine conditions
- `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=` compare values

## 🎯 Final Practice Mission

Create a simple game score calculator:

1. Start with base_score
2. Add 100 bonus points if player has power_up
3. Double the score if it's a critical_hit
4. Check if it's a new high score!

<PythonCodeEditor
 initialCode={`# Here's what we want to do:
base_score = 50
has_power_up = True
is_critical_hit = True
current_high_score = 200
# Your code here!`}
 expectedOutput={`300
 New High Score: True`}
