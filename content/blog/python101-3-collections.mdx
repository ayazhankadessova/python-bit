# Level Up: Python's Super Storage Powers! 🦸‍♂️

Hey coding champions! Ready to learn about Python's amazing ways to store and organize stuff? It's like having different types of super-powered containers for your data! 🎮

## 1. Lists: Your Digital Backpack 🎒

Imagine you're packing for an epic adventure. A list in Python is like your backpack - you can put anything in it, take stuff out, add more things, and even change what's inside!

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Let's pack our adventure backpack!
my_backpack = ["map", "water bottle", "snacks", "lucky charm"]
print("In my backpack:", my_backpack)

# Oops, forgot something! Let's add it
my_backpack.append("flashlight")
print("Added a flashlight:", my_backpack)

# Let's check what's in the first pocket
print("First item:", my_backpack[0])  # Remember, Python starts counting at 0!
  `}
  exercise_number={1}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 🍎 Quick Challenge: Fruit Basket Organizer!

### Challenge: 
1. Follow the order to add "apple", "banana", "orange"
2. Use .append() to add fruits one by one
3. Use .extend() to add multiple fruits at once
4. Print out your fruit basket

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Your mission: Add some delicious fruits: "apple", "banana", "orange"
fruit_basket = [] 
  `}
  expectedOutput={`['apple', 'banana', 'orange']`}
  exercise_number={2}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 2. Tuples: The Unbreakable Container 🔒

Think of tuples like your favorite LEGO set - once it's built, you can't change the pieces! They're perfect for things that shouldn't change, like the days of the week or your birthday.

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Your birthday will always be the same!
my_birthday = (7, "December", 2010)  # Can't change this!

# RGB colors in games are tuples too!
red = (255, 0, 0)
green = (0, 255, 0)
blue = (0, 0, 255)

print("My birthday is on:", my_birthday[0], my_birthday[1])`}
  exercise_number={3}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 🗺️ Quick Tuple Challenge: Geocaching Coordinates! 

### Challenge:

- Create a tuple to represent a secret geocache location

1. Make a tuple with 3 elements: (latitude, longitude, depth) => (37.7749, -122.4194, 10)
2. Print out latitude
3. Print out full location

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Your mission: Create a secret geocache location!
  
  geocache_location = () 

  print("Latitude:", ...)
  print("Full Location:", ...)`}
  exercise_number={4}
  expectedOutput={`Latitude: 37.7749
  Full Location: (37.7749, -122.4194, 10)`}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 3. Dictionaries: Your Personal Game Guide 🗺️

Dictionaries are like your game cheat sheet - each item (key) has its own special information (value). It's perfect for storing character stats or game settings!

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Let's create a game character!
player = {
    "name": "CoolGamer123",
    "level": 42,
    "health": 100,
    "powers": ["super jump", "invisibility"],
    "has_magic_sword": True
}

print("Player name:", player["name"])
print("Player level:", player["level"])

# Add a new power!
player["powers"].append("fire blast")
print("Updated powers:", player["powers"])`}
  exercise_number={5}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 🎮 Quick Challenge: Video Game Inventory System!

### Challenge:
1. Build an inventory with these 3 items
```
"health_potion": 5,
"magic_scroll": 3,
"golden_key": 1
```
2. Add += 2 to the health potion quantity
3. Update an item's quantity
4. Print out your entire inventory
5. Print Health Potions total quantity

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Adventure game inventory
game_inventory = {
    "health_potion": 5,
    ...
}

# Add more of a specific item
game_inventory[".."] += 2

# Print total items and specific item details
print("Full Inventory:", ...)
print("Health Potions:", ...)
`}
expectedOutput={`Full Inventory: {'health_potion': 7, 'magic_scroll': 3, 'golden_key': 1}
Health Potions: 7`}
  exercise_number={6}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 4. Sets: Your Sticker Collection 🌟

Sets are like your sticker collection - you can't have duplicates! If you try to add the same sticker twice, it only keeps one copy.

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Let's create a set of Minecraft items!
minecraft_items = {"diamond", "sword", "pickaxe", "diamond"}  # Notice two diamonds?
print("My items:", minecraft_items)  # Only one diamond appears!

# Let's add more items
minecraft_items.add("torch")
print("Added a torch:", minecraft_items)`}
  exercise_number={7}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 🏆 Quick Challenge: Battle Royale Loadout! 

### Challenge:

1. Create a set of weapons `"assault rifle", "shotgun", "sniper", "grenades"`
2. Try to add a duplicate weapon
3. Remove a weapon from your set `"grenades"`
4. Check the total number of unique weapons

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Create a set of unique battle royale weapons

battle_loadout = set()  

battle_loadout.add("assault rifle")  # Won't create a duplicate!

# Add a new weapon
battle_loadout.add(...)

# Remove a weapon
battle_loadout.remove(...)

# Print loadout details
print("Total Unique Weapons:", len(...))
`}
  exercise_number={8}
  expectedOutput={`Total Unique Weapons: 4`}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 🎮 Time for a Mini-Game: Collection Master!

Let's create a simple game inventory system using all our new powers!

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Your mission: Create the ultimate game character!
# Follow the hints carefully to match the exact solution

# 1. Weapons Arsenal
weapons = ["sword", "bow", "magic staff"]
# Challenge: Add these SPECIFIC weapons to your list
# - Add "throwing axe"
# - Add "crossbow"

# 2. Character Classes (keep this unchanged)
character_classes = ("warrior", "archer", "mage")

# 3. Character Creation
my_character = {
    "name": "???",  
    "class": "???", 
    "inventory": weapons,
    "level": 1
}
# Challenges:
# - Set name to "DragonSlayer99"
# - Set class to "warrior"
# - Make sure your weapons list is correct

# 4. Achievements
achievements = {"beginner", "monster_slayer", "treasure_hunter"}
# Challenge: Add these SPECIFIC achievements
# - Add "epic_quest_complete"
# - Add "boss_defeated"

# Print your gaming profile!
print("=== PLAYER PROFILE ===")
print("Name:", ...)
print("Class:", ...)
print("Weapons:", ...)
print("Total Achievements:", ...)
`}
  exercise_number={9}
  expectedOutput={`=== PLAYER PROFILE ===
  Name: DragonSlayer99
  Class: warrior
  Weapons: ['sword', 'bow', 'magic staff', 'throwing axe', 'crossbow']
  Total Achievements: 5`}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 🎯 Debug Mission: Spot the Bugs!

Can you find and fix the problems in this code?

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`# Make this code correct!
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_tuple[0] = 5 # Can we change tuple values? 🤔
player_stats = {"health": 100, "health": 200} # Duplicate keys? 🤔
my_set = {"red", "blue", "red", "green"} # Duplicate values? 🤔

print("Tuple:", my_tuple)
print("Player Stats:", player_stats)
print("Length of my set:", len(my_set))
`}
  exercise_number={10}
  expectedOutput={`Tuple: (1, 2, 3)
  Player Stats: {'health': 200}
  Length of my set: 3`}
  tutorial_id="python101-3-collections"
/>

## 🌈 Remember:

- Lists are like your backpack (can change anytime)
- Tuples are like LEGO sets (can't change after building)
- Dictionaries are like game guides (each thing has its info)
- Sets are like sticker collections (no duplicates allowed!)
