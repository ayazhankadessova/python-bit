##  1. What are Variables? 📦 

Think of variables like your own digital backpack - they're containers where you can store different things! Just like how you might have:
- A pocket for your phone 📱
- A space for your books 📚
- A special spot for your snacks 🍪

In Python, variables are like these pockets where we can store different types of information!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Let's create some digital pockets!
my_favorite_number = 42
my_name = "Alex"
am_i_learning_python = True

print(my_favorite_number)  # Your computer remembers the number!
print(my_name)            # It remembers your name too!`}
  exercise_number={1}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

<div id='TheCoolRulesforNamingYourVariables'></div>
##  2. The Cool Rules for Naming Your Variables 📝

Just like how you can't name a pet "123" (imagine calling that at the park! 😅), Python has some rules for naming variables:

1. Start with a letter or underscore (_)
2. Can use letters, numbers, and underscores
3. NO SPACES allowed! (use_underscores_instead)
4. Names are case-sensitive (myName and myname are different!)

```python showLineNumbers
good_name = "Perfect!" ✅
123_bad_name = "Nope!" ❌
my space = "Won't work!" ❌
```

##  3. Different Types of Data: Python's Collection 🎨

Imagine your digital backpack has special pockets that only hold certain types of things - just like how you wouldn't put a juice box in your pencil case! Let's discover Python's special containers:

<div id='Integersint:TheWholeNumbersGang'></div>
###  3.1. Integers (int): The Whole Numbers Gang 🔢

These are your everyday counting numbers! No decimals allowed in this club.
- Ages (like 10, 11, 12)
- Number of pets (1, 2, 3)
- High score in your favorite game (1000!)

When we want to combine numbers with text using `+`, we need to use a special magic spell called `str()`. It's like giving our numbers a special costume so they can join the text party! 🎉

Fix this code by adding `str(12)`:

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`print("My age: " + 12)  # ❌ Oops! This makes Python sad`} 
  exercise_number={2}
  expectedOutput="My age: 12"
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

Fix this code by adding the following to your code: `str()` where needed.

<PythonCodeEditor
  initialCode={`my_age = 12
number_of_pets = 3
favorite_number = 42

# Use str() to turn numbers into text when adding them to strings
print("My age: " + my_age)
print("Number of pets: " + str(number_of_pets))
print("Favorite number: " + favorite_number)`}
  exercise_number={3}
  expectedOutput= {
    `My age: 12
Number of pets: 3
Favorite number: 42`
  }
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

<div id='FloatingPointsfloat:TheDecimalSquad'></div>
###  3.2. Floating Points (float): The Decimal Squad 🎯

These numbers love to play with decimal points! They're perfect for:
- Your height (5.5 feet)
- Temperature (72.3 degrees)
- Pizza slices (you can have 2.5 slices!)
- Money in your piggy bank ($10.25)

Just like integers, floats need the `str()` spell to play nice with text strings!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`my_height = 5.5        # Perfect for measurements!
pizza_slices = 3.14    # Mm... pi! 🥧

print("My height: " + my_height)
print("Pizza slices: " + pizza_slices)`}
  exercise_number={4}
  expectedOutput={`
  My height: 5.5
  Pizza slices: 3.14`}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

<div id='Stringsstr:TheTextTeam'></div>
###  3.3. Strings (str): The Text Team 📝

Strings are like text messages - they can hold letters, words, sentences, and even emojis! 
- Names ("Alex", "Sam")
- Secret messages ("Meet me at lunch!")
- Favorite colors ("blue")
- Even numbers in quotes ("42" - but you can't do math with these!)

Pro Tip: Strings need to wear quotation marks (" ") like a special uniform!

No need to add `str()` here! We are connecting strings with strings.

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`my_name = "Alex"
favorite_game = "Minecraft"
secret_message = "Don't worry about apostrophes!"

print("My name: " + my_name)
print("Favorite game: " + favorite_game)
print("Secret message: " + secret_message)`}
  exercise_number={5}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

<div id='Booleansbool:TheYesNoCrew'></div>
###  3.4. Booleans (bool): The Yes/No Crew ✅❌

Booleans are like light switches - they can only be True or False. Super useful for:
- Checking if a game is over (game_over = True)
- Seeing if you completed your homework (homework_done = False)
- Keeping track if you're logged in (is_logged_in = True)
- Testing if it's your birthday (is_birthday = True)

Fun fact: Booleans are named after George Boole, a mathematician who loved working with true/false logic!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`is_python_fun = True
am_i_tired = False

print(is_python_fun)
print(am_i_tired)`}
  exercise_number={6}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

<div id='FunWithVariables'></div>
##  4. Fun With Variables! 🎪

Watch what happens when we mix and match:

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Creating a cool greeting
name = "Jesse"
age = 13
greeting = "Hi! I'm " + name + " and I'm " + str(age) + " years old!"
print(greeting)

# Making a multiplication party
high_five = "🖐 " * 5
print(high_five)  # Prints five high fives!`}
  exercise_number={7}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

<div id='ProTipsforWorkingwithDifferentTypes'></div>
##  5. Pro Tips for Working with Different Types 🌟

1. 🔄 Type Conversion Spells:
   - `str()` turns things into text
   - `int()` turns things into whole numbers
   - `float()` turns things into decimal numbers
   - `bool()` turns things into True/False

2. 🎨 Mixing Types:
   - Text + Text = Works! ✅ ("Hello " + "there")
   - Text + Number = Needs str()! ❌ ("Age: " + str(12))
   - Number + Number = Math! ✅ (5 + 3 = 8)

3. 🎯 When to Use Each:
   - Counting things? Use integers!
   - Measuring things? Use floats!
   - Writing messages? Use strings!
   - Yes/No questions? Use booleans!

<div id='Mission:CodeYourProfile'></div>
##  6. 🎯 Mission: Code Your Profile!

Let's create a coder profile! Try to fill in this code for Amy:

1. Name: "Amy"
2. age = 24
3. Favorite hobby: "Gaming"
4. Likes coding: True

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Create Amy's coder profile!
my_name = "???"               # Your name here
my_age = ???                 # Your age here
my_favorite_hobby = "???"     # What do you love doing?
likes_coding = ???           # True or False?

# Don't change this part - it's magic! ✨
print("=======================")
print("🎮 CODER PROFILE 🎮")
print("=======================")
print("Name:", my_name)
print("Age:", my_age)
print("Hobby:", my_favorite_hobby)
print("Loves Coding:", likes_coding)
print("=======================")`}
  expectedOutput="=======================
🎮 CODER PROFILE 🎮
=======================
Name: Amy
Age: 24
Hobby: Gaming
Loves Coding: True
======================="
  exercise_number={8}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"

<div id='BonusChallenge:VariableValor'></div>
##  7. 🌟 Bonus Challenge: Variable Valor!

Can you guess what these will do? Try them out!

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`# Mystery Code 1
print("ha" * 5)

# Mystery Code 2
first = "python"
last = "rules"
print(first + " " + last)`}
  exercise_number={9}
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

<div id='FinalMission:FixtheBrokenCode'></div>
##  8. 🎯 Final Mission: Fix the Broken Code!

Detective work time! This code has some problems. Fix it and print:

```python showLineNumbers
"Sam is 13 years old and loves the number 3.5!"
```

<PythonCodeEditor 
  initialCode={`Name = "Sam"
age = "13"
is cool = True
favorite_number = 3.5`}
  exercise_number={10}
  expectedOutput= "Sam is 13 years old and loves the number 3.5!"
  tutorial_id="python101-2-variables-types"
/>

Remember: Every great coder started exactly where you are now! Keep experimenting, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - they're just learning opportunities in disguise! 🌈
