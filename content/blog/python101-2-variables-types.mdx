# Level Up: Python Variables and Data Types! 🎮

Hey coding champions! Remember how you made your computer say hello? Now we're going to learn how to make it remember things! 🧠

## What are Variables? 📦

Think of variables like your own digital backpack - they're containers where you can store different things! Just like how you might have:
- A pocket for your phone 📱
- A space for your books 📚
- A special spot for your snacks 🍪

In Python, variables are like these pockets where we can store different types of information!

```python showLineNumbers
# Let's create some digital pockets!
my_favorite_number = 42
my_name = "Alex"
am_i_learning_python = True

print(my_favorite_number)  # Your computer remembers the number!
print(my_name)            # It remembers your name too!
```

## The Cool Rules for Naming Your Variables 📝

Just like how you can't name a pet "123" (imagine calling that at the park! 😅), Python has some rules for naming variables:

1. Start with a letter or underscore (_)
2. Can use letters, numbers, and underscores
3. NO SPACES allowed! (use_underscores_instead)
4. Names are case-sensitive (myName and myname are different!)

```python showLineNumbers
good_name = "Perfect!" ✅
123_bad_name = "Nope!" ❌
my space = "Won't work!" ❌
```

## Different Types of Data: Python's Collection 🎨

Just like how you wouldn't store a sandwich 🥪 in your pencil case ✏️, Python has different types of data that go in different types of variables. Let's meet them!

### 1. Integers (int): The Whole Numbers Gang 🔢
```python showLineNumbers
my_age = 12
number_of_pets = 3
favorite_number = 42
```

### 2. Floating Points (float): The Decimal Squad 🎯
```python showLineNumbers
my_height = 5.5        # Perfect for measurements!
pizza_slices = 3.14    # Mm... pi! 🥧
```

### 3. Strings (str): The Text Team 📝
```python showLineNumbers
my_name = "Alex"
favorite_game = "Minecraft"
secret_message = "Don't worry about apostrophes!"
```

### 4. Booleans (bool): The Yes/No Crew ✅❌
```python showLineNumbers
is_python_fun = True
am_i_tired = False
```

## Fun With Variables! 🎪

Watch what happens when we mix and match:

```python showLineNumbers
# Creating a cool greeting
name = "Jesse"
age = 13
greeting = "Hi! I'm " + name + " and I'm " + str(age) + " years old!"
print(greeting)

# Making a multiplication party
high_five = "🖐 " * 5
print(high_five)  # Prints five high fives!
```

## 🎯 Mission: Code Your Profile!

Let's create your coder profile! Try to fill in this code:

```python showLineNumbers
# Create your coder profile!
my_name = "???"               # Your name here
my_age = ???                 # Your age here
my_favorite_hobby = "???"     # What do you love doing?
likes_coding = ???           # True or False?

# Don't change this part - it's magic! ✨
print("=======================")
print("🎮 CODER PROFILE 🎮")
print("=======================")
print("Name:", my_name)
print("Age:", my_age)
print("Hobby:", my_favorite_hobby)
print("Loves Coding:", likes_coding)
print("=======================")
```

## 🌟 Bonus Challenge: Variable Valor!

Can you guess what these will do? Try them out!

```python showLineNumbers
# Mystery Code 1
print("ha" * 5)

# Mystery Code 2
first = "python"
last = "rules"
print(first + " " + last)
```

## 🎯 Final Mission: Fix the Broken Code!

Detective work time! This code has some problems. Can you fix it?

```python showLineNumbers
Name = "Sam"
age = "13"
is cool = True
favorite_number = 3.5

# We want to print: "Sam is 13 years old and loves the number 3.5!"
```

Remember: Every great coder started exactly where you are now! Keep experimenting, and don't be afraid to make mistakes - they're just learning opportunities in disguise! 🌈

Need a hint? Just ask! Together, we'll crack the code! 💪
