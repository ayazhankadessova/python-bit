# Level Up: Decision-Making Powers! 🎮

Hey coding champions! Remember those awesome string powers we learned? Now it's time to learn something even cooler - how to make your code THINK and DECIDE! Just like in games where you choose different paths on your quest, conditional statements let your code make smart choices! 🧙‍♂️

## Today's Quest! 🎯
You'll learn how to:
- Make your code choose different paths like in an adventure game! 🗺️
- Use magical comparison operators to test conditions ✨
- Chain multiple decisions together for complex quests 🔗
- Check if items exist in your inventory using the 'in' operator 🎒

## Your First Decision Spell: if Statements! 🪄

Remember our string operations? Let's use them with conditions:

```python showLineNumbers
player_name = "DragonSlayer"

# Check if the player name is long enough
if len(player_name) >= 3:
    print("Welcome to the game, " + player_name + "!")
else:
    print("Name too short! Choose a longer name!")

# Check if it's a special character name
if player_name.startswith("Dragon"):
    print("🐲 You have dragon-taming powers!")
```

## Comparison Magic: Testing Conditions! ⚔️

```python showLineNumbers
player_health = 100
dragon_nearby = True

# Different ways to compare things:
if player_health == 100:    # Equal to
    print("Health is full! ❤️")
    
if player_health > 50:      # Greater than
    print("Ready for battle! ⚔️")
    
if dragon_nearby != False:  # Not equal to
    print("Dragon alert! 🐲")
```

## Secret Inventory Checker: the 'in' Operator! 🎒

```python showLineNumbers
# Using our string split power from last lesson!
inventory = "Sword,Shield,Potion,Map".split(",")

if "Sword" in inventory:
    print("You're armed and ready! ⚔️")
    
if "Map" in inventory:
    print("You can find the treasure! 🗺️")

# Check multiple conditions
if "Shield" in inventory and "Armor" not in inventory:
    print("You have some defense, but could use armor! 🛡️")
```

## Multiple Choice Paths: elif Adventures! 🗺️

```python showLineNumbers
player_class = "Mage"

if player_class.lower() == "warrior":
    print("You charge into battle with your sword! ⚔️")
elif player_class.lower() == "mage":
    print("You cast powerful spells! 🔮")
elif player_class.lower() == "archer":
    print("You attack from a distance! 🏹")
else:
    print("Unknown class! Create your own adventure!")
```

## Boss Battle: Complex Conditions! 🐉

```python showLineNumbers
dragon_health = 100
player_level = 5
has_magic_sword = True

if (player_level >= 5 and has_magic_sword) or dragon_health < 50:
    print("You can defeat the dragon! 🗡️")
else:
    print("Train more or find the magic sword! 💪")
```

## 🎮 Mini-Game: The Quest Checker!

```python showLineNumbers
# Quest status checker
quest_status = "ACTIVE"
quest_items_found = ["map", "compass", "key"]
quest_level = 3

# Your mission:
# 1. Check if the quest is "ACTIVE"
# 2. Check if the player has all required items
# 3. Check if player meets minimum level (level 2)
# Write your code here!
```

## 🌟 Super Challenge: Create a Game Choice System!

```python showLineNumbers
# You're at a crossroads in your adventure!
path_chosen = "cave"
player_hp = 80
has_torch = True

# Create conditions to check:
# 1. If player chose "cave":
#    - Must have torch and hp > 50
# 2. If player chose "mountain":
#    - Must have hp > 70
# 3. If player chose "forest":
#    - Can enter anytime!

# Your code here!
```

## 🎯 Debug Mission: Fix the Game Logic!

Can you spot what's wrong with these conditions?

```python showLineNumbers
# Bug 1: Why doesn't this work?
player_power = "100"
if player_power > 50:
    print("Super strong!")

# Bug 2: What's wrong here?
weapon = "Sword"
if weapon = "Sword":
    print("Armed!")

# Bug 3: Can you spot the logic error?
is_day = True
has_sunglasses = True
if is_day and has_sunglasses:
    print("Too dark to see!")
```

Remember:
- Always check your comparison operators `(==, !=, >, <, >=, <=)`
- Pay attention to your indentation - Python is picky!
- String comparison is case-sensitive ("Sword" != "sword")
- Use 'and' to check multiple conditions that all must be True
- Use 'or' when any one condition can be True

## Final Boss Challenge: Create a Complete Game Check System!

```python showLineNumbers
# Create a system that checks:
player_stats = """
NAME: MightyHero
LEVEL: 7
HEALTH: 85
INVENTORY: Sword,Shield,Potion
CURRENT_QUEST: DefeatDragon
"""

# 1. Parse the player_stats (use your string powers!)
# 2. Check if player is ready for dragon battle:
#    - Level must be 5 or higher
#    - Health must be above 80
#    - Must have both Sword and Shield
#    - Current quest must be "DefeatDragon"
# 3. Print appropriate messages for each condition

# Your code here!
```
