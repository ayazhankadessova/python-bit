  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "q1",
      "question": "What will the output of this code be? ```python\ntreasure = 100 % 3```",
      "options": ["33", "1", "0", "33.33"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The % operator finds the remainder after division. When 100 is divided by 3, the result is 33 with a remainder of 1."
    },
    {
      "id": "q2",
      "question": "Which operator would you use to repeat a string multiple times?",
      "options": ["+", "*", "/", "**"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The * operator repeats strings when used with a string and a number. For example, 'Hi! ' * 3 gives 'Hi! Hi! Hi! '."
    },
    {
      "id": "q3",
      "question": "What will this expression evaluate to? 2 ** 3",
      "options": ["6", "8", "5", "23"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The ** operator performs exponentiation. 2 raised to the power of 3 is 2 × 2 × 2 = 8."
    },
    {
      "id": "q4",
      "question": "What's wrong with this code? ```python\nplayer_health = '100' + 50```",
      "options": [
        "You can't add to player health",
        "The variable name is invalid",
        "You can't add a string and a number",
        "The number 50 should be in quotes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "You cannot directly add a string ('100') and a number (50) in Python. You need to convert the string to a number first with int('100') + 50, or both to strings: '100' + str(50)."
    },
    {
      "id": "q5",
      "question": "Which operator checks if two values are equal?",
      "options": ["=", "==", "!=", "==="],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The == operator checks if two values are equal. The single = is for assignment, not comparison."
    },
    {
      "id": "q6",
      "question": "What will chest_1 + chest_2 do if ```python\nchest_1 = ['sword', 'shield']\nchest_2 = ['potion', 'map']```?",
      "options": [
        "Create a dictionary with items from both lists",
        "Combine the items into a new list: ['sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'map']",
        "Cause an error because you can't add lists",
        "Return the total number of items (4)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The + operator combines lists, creating a new list with all items from both lists: ['sword', 'shield', 'potion', 'map']."
    },
    {
      "id": "q7",
      "question": "What is the result of ```python\nTrue and False```?",
      "options": ["True", "False", "None", "Error"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The and operator returns True only if both conditions are True. Since one condition is False, the result is False."
    },
    {
      "id": "q8",
      "question": "What's the value of has_power in this code? ```python\nhas_sword = True\nhas_shield = True\nhas_power = has_sword or has_shield and False\n```",
      "options": ["True", "False", "None", "Error"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "In Python, `and` has higher precedence than `or`. So this is evaluated as: `has_power = has_sword or (has_shield and False)` which simplifies to `has_power = True or False` which equals `True`."
    },
    {
      "id": "q9",
      "question": "What will ```python\npower_ups * 3``` produce if ```python\npower_ups = ['⭐']```?",
      "options": [
        "['⭐⭐⭐']",
        "['⭐', '⭐', '⭐']",
        "Error: can't multiply lists",
        "3"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When you multiply a list by a number, it repeats the list that many times. So ['⭐'] * 3 gives ['⭐', '⭐', '⭐']."
    },
    {
      "id": "q10",
      "question": "What's wrong with this code? ```python\nis_high_score = score = high_score```",
      "options": [
        "Variable names can't have underscores",
        "You should use == for comparison, not =",
        "You can't assign multiple variables at once",
        "high_score needs to be defined first"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The = operator assigns values, it doesn't compare them. To check if score equals high_score, you should use the == operator: is_high_score = (score == high_score)."
    }
  ]
