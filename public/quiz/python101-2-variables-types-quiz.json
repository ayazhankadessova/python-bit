      "question": "Which of the following is a valid variable name in Python?",
      "options": ["123_variable", "my variable", "first_variable", "@variable"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Variable names must start with a letter or underscore, and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores. They cannot start with a number or contain spaces.",

        "String (str)",
        "Integer (int)",
        "Float (float)",
        "Boolean (bool)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The value 42 is a whole number with no decimal point, which makes it an integer (int) in Python."

      "question": "What data type is the value 3.14?",
      "options": [
        "String (str)",
        "Integer (int)",
        "Float (float)",
        "Boolean (bool)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The value 3.14 is a number with a decimal point, which makes it a floating-point number (float) in Python.",

      "options": ["hahaha", "ha ha ha", "ha3", "Error"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "When you multiply a string by a number in Python, it repeats the string that many times. So 'ha' * 3 gives 'hahaha'."

      "id": "q5",
      "question": "Which function do you use to convert a number to a string?",
      "options": ["int()", "float()", "bool()", "str()"],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "The str() function converts values to strings, allowing them to be concatenated with other strings using the + operator.",

      "options": [
        "The age should be in quotation marks",
        "We need to use str(12) to convert the number to a string",
        "We should use a comma instead of +",
        "The variable name is missing"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "You can't directly concatenate a string and a number with the + operator. You need to convert the number to a string first using str()."

        "Boolean (bool)"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 3,
      "explanation": "True is a Boolean value (bool), which can only be either True or False. Booleans are commonly used for conditions and flags.",

    {
      "id": "q8",

      "options": ["Sam Sam", "SamSam", "Sam2", "Error"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "When you multiply a string by a number, it repeats the string that many times without adding spaces. So 'Sam' * 2 gives 'SamSam'."

        "Variable names can't contain spaces"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Variable names cannot start with a number. They must start with a letter or underscore, though they can contain numbers after that.",

      "id": "q10",

        "The variable name contains a space",
        "Boolean values should be lowercase (true)",
        "You can't use 'is' in a variable name",
